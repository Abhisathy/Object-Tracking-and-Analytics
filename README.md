# Object Tracking and Analytics
We use pose detection and train a CNN (convolutional neural net) to recognize everyday objects like people and vehicles present in the real environment from video footage. The system would be able to recognize objects even when they are in motion and track their movement for analysis. We use real-world footage recorded or obtained from the internet to train and test our model. In addition, we modify this system to track vehicles in videos to generate and analyze traffic patterns to plan an intuitive traffic infrastructure.

## Project Report
Consists of all the theory, observations and discussions based on the project and includes intuitive data, tables and plots to analyze the applications of the system.

## Sample system generated video file
The file bu_tracking.mp4 is one of the sample video files processed by the system using bounding boxes and significant points that illustrate the concept of tracking and pose estimation. 
PS: The tracking displayed in the video has minor bugs with respect to the bounding boxes.
